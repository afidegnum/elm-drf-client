# elm-drf-client
Since I know about elm-lang I was in process of finding the good task to test it for real world problem.  
I decide that autogenerated admin UI based on REST schema is a good challenge.
I have created a simple Django based app, which provides JSON API based on Django rest framework and implements elm based frontend for it.
Frontend load information about resources available via API. Then it loads those schemas.
After that, it could show to you a table of content and provide the ability to add and edit items.  


You could simple lunch the app via docker-compose.  
You just need to run `docker-compose up` and wait for a while.   
Then you could open `http://localhost:3000/src/Main.elm#answer`
